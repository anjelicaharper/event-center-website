# HTML & CSS Project | Event Center Website

# Description
Event Center is a responsive, multi-page website designed to promote a vibrant music festival and entertainment venue. Built using HTML and CSS, this site provides a clean, user-friendly experience for visitors looking to explore upcoming events, browse the food menu, find the event location, or get in touch through the contact form.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate proficiency in front-end web development fundamentals, including layout design, semantic HTML structure, external CSS styling, form validation, and responsive design techniques across different devices and browsers.

## Notes

Building this website really helped me connect the dots between what I’ve learned and how it all comes together in a real-world setting. Writing semantic HTML and organizing styles with CSS felt much more intuitive once I started applying it to an actual multi-page layout.

I gained a much deeper understanding of how structure and styling work together — from using Flexbox to build responsive event sections, to fine-tuning the layout with media queries for different screen sizes. Creating the contact form also helped reinforce how validation works right in the browser without any JavaScript.

Overall, this hands-on experience made the concepts feel more concrete. It pushed me to think not just about how things look, but also how users interact with a site — and how to write clean, reusable code that makes that experience better.
